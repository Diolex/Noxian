Currently uses a Postgresql database

Python Modules required:
- PyRiot (Modified version): Riot Games Developer API wrapper for python
  - get the base package with "pip install pyriot"
  - or from https://github.com/evangs/pyriot
  - I'll be uploading my modified bugfix version soon

- psycopg2: handling the Postgres database

- numpy, sklearn, and a few others(?)
